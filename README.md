# AI Assignment 1: Graph Search Algorithms

## Introduction
In this assignment, we will implement and compare different graph search algorithms. We will use the following algorithms:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)


We will use the following graph search problems:
- City Graph Search
- Random Graph Search

[X] We will compare the performance of these algorithms on these problems and analyze the results.

[X] We will also calculate the centrality of nodes in the graph and analyze the results.

[X] We will also compare the performance of different graph representations - Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, and Edge List - by evaluating their efficiency on various graph operations.

[X] We will mark the nodes visited during the graph search algorithms to visualize their traversal paths.
